            <h4 class="content__heading mt__40">Who's a Web Developer?</h4>
            <p class="content__paragraph">
              A web developer is a specialist who creates websites for people or companies. A full-stack web developer works on the website’s front-end and back-end elements.
            </p>
            <p class="content__paragraph">
              The appearance of websites when they are sent to clients is covered by the front-end component. On the other hand, the back-end component securely processes and stores data.
            </p>
            <p class="content__paragraph">
              Web developers are one of the most in-demand occupations in the modern digital world, as practically every company seeks its own website. They are among the highest paid professions because of the magnitude of influence their expertise has.
            </p>
            <p class="content__paragraph">
              Even working as a web developer may be entertaining and lucrative. Their work necessitates patience, concentration, and an enthusiasm for a variety of instruments and technology.
            </p>
            <p class="content__paragraph">
              If you’re one of those tech nerds interested in learning about web development, this site is for you.
            </p>

            <h4 class="content__heading mt__40">What is web development?</h4>
            <p class="content__paragraph">
              As was already said, the process of creating a website is known as web development. Let’s comprehend the operation of a website and the differences between front-end and back-end development. The two of these principles should be learned as part of a web developer’s roadmap.
            </p>

            <h4 class="content__heading mt__40">How does a website work?</h4>
            <p class="content__paragraph">
              At its core, every website is just a collection of files kept on a computer system known as a server. This server then establishes a connection to the internet. Afterward, you can use a browser on your device, such as Chrome, Safari, or Firefox, to access the specific website.
            </p>
            <p class="content__paragraph">
              As a result, whenever you browse the internet, you get data (such photographs of dogs) through the server and send data back to the server (load more dog images). The basis of the internet can be thought of as this back and forth data exchange between the server and you (the client).
            </p>
            <p class="content__paragraph">
              Any component that you may access through your browser, especially a website, was created by a web developer.
            </p>
            <p class="content__paragraph">
              These components range from corporate websites and content to extremely complex web services like Amazon, Twitter, and LinkedIn.
            </p>

            <h4 class="content__heading mt__40">What’s the difference between front-end and back-end?</h4>
            <p class="content__paragraph">
              The terms “front-end,” “back-end,” and “full-stack” web development specify which client/server component you’ll be working on (here, “client” can refer to a web browser, such as Google Chrome, Firefox, etc., whereas “server” is a web application server at a remote location that will process web requests and send pages to the client).
            </p>
            <p class="content__paragraph">
              The work you’ll be doing is referred to as “front-end” and will mostly concern the client side, or the area of the website that users interact with. It is referred to as the “front-end,” because it contains elements that you may view in your browser.
            </p>
            <p class="content__paragraph">
              On the other hand, the “back-end” is the part of a website you can’t see, but it deals with a lot of important functionality and logic and is in charge of how a website functions internally.
            </p>

            <h5 class="content__heading2">1. Select a Technology</h5>
            <p class="content__paragraph">
              Database administration, front-end development, and back-end development are all included in full-stack development. The technology you should use depends on specific users, requirements, and implementations.
            </p>
            <p class="content__paragraph">
              <span class="font__bold">1. MERN:</span> The most popular and well-known technology right now is MERN. The following four technologies are represented by the four letters in it.
            </p>
            <p class="content__paragraph">
              M — MongoDB: For high-volume data storage, MongoDB is a document-oriented NoSQL (normally, databases utilise SQL to store and retrieve data) database. <br>
              E — Express is a node js web application framework that offers a wide range of functionality for creating web and mobile applications. It covers operations such as GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE. <br>
              R — React: React is a JavaScript library used to create single-page apps and create user interfaces. <br>
              N — NodeJS: Node.js is an open-source server-side JavaScript code execution platform. Real-time apps frequently employ Node, which is helpful for creating applications that need a persistent connection between the browser and the server. <br>
            </p>

            <p class="content__paragraph">
              <span class="font__bold">2. MEAN:</span> The main difference between MERN and MEAN is that the former deals with React while the latter is compatible with Angular, a TypeScript-based framework.
            </p>

            <h5 class="content__heading2">2. Front-end Development</h5>
            <p class="content__paragraph">
              The front-end, or user interface, controls the website’s overall appearance, including how interactive and robust it is. The majority of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript fundamentals should be known to you in order to understand front-end programming.
            </p>
            <p class="content__paragraph">
              <span class="font__bold">HTML: </span> Create a simple website that consists of the essential pieces to start learning HTML (HyperText Markup Language). Try out tables and forms, and see if you can enhance the website with links and pictures. This will enhance the aesthetic appeal of your website and attest to the high calibre of your work.
            </p>
            <p class="content__paragraph">
              <span class="font__bold">CSS (Cascading Style Sheets):</span> CSS is something you should explore if you value originality. Using CSS, you may add colours to the page, give paragraphs or titles borders, make navigation bars, test various fonts, text styles, icons, and fonts, among many other similar features. Make the project compelling by incorporating imagination into it. View it on various screen sizes to see how it appears. Bootstrap is one of the CSS frameworks that is most frequently used.
            </p>
            <p class="content__paragraph">
              <span class="font__bold">Javascript:</span> The web’s primary programming language is called JavaScript. You ought to be familiar with DOM and APIs.Javascript : The web’s primary programming language is called JavaScript. You ought to be familiar with DOM and APIs.
            </p>
            <p class="content__paragraph">
              <span class="font__bold">Frameworks:</span> Frameworks serve as the foundation on which software applications are built. When combined, they consist of programmes, code libraries, and compilers that permit the creation of a particular system or project. These frameworks make it possible for components to be reused. These frameworks include React, Vue, Angular, etc. as examples.
            </p>

            <h5 class="content__heading2">3. Back-end Development</h5>
            <p class="content__paragraph">
              The mechanism for transmitting the correct data from the client and getting it from the server is present in the server-compatible code. It also includes the database that holds the data used by the programme.
            </p>

            <span>It constitues three segments: </span>
            <ul class="content__list">
              <li>a server</li>
              <li>an application</li>
              <li>a database</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="content__paragraph">
              Developers write the code for this system, which transfers data from the relevant database to the browser. Back-end programmers create the code that transmits data from the database to the browser. The following is a list of the abilities a back-end developer must possess:
            </p>

            <p class="content__paragraph">
              <span class="font__bold">Programming Languages:</span> Expertise in one of the main programming languages, such as Java, Python, or JavaScript, is required of back-end developers. Since JavaScript can be used in both the front-end and back-end, it might be the best choice to start with. But you should always use the language that best matches your requirements.
            </p>
            <p class="content__paragraph">
              <span class="font__bold">Frameworks:</span> Frameworks are typically added features or parts that improve the performance of development. It includes all of the tools and modules used to create a website’s structure. Useful back-end frameworks include Django, Express, Ruby on Rails, and others.
            </p>
            <p class="content__paragraph">
              <span class="font__bold">Database:</span> Numerous BMS (Building Management System) technologies, including MongoDB, MySQL, Oracle, SQL Server, etc., are used for databases. It has to do with managing and storing data.
            </p>
            <p class="content__paragraph">
              <span class="font__bold">Server:</span> A server is a piece of software that controls how users access data, services, or programmes across a network. They are in charge of facilitating information/data transfer between the server and the client.
            </p>
            <p class="content__paragraph">
              <span class="font__bold">Application Programme Interface (API):</span> An API is a set of guidelines that enables interaction or acts as a mediator between apps. The server’s reply satisfies the user’s request.
            </p>
            <p class="content__paragraph">
              <span class="font__bold">Client-Server Architecture:</span> Using a client-server architecture, it is possible to understand the request and the received response. Every time the client makes a request for the server to collect necessary data, the server responds. A database then enters the picture and is in charge of keeping the data.
            </p>

            <h5 class="content__heading2">4. Database</h5>
            <p class="content__paragraph">
              A structured information collection called a database is frequently stored electronically in a computer system. The two main categories of databases are relational (SQL, which keeps the data in tables) and non-relational (NoSQL, which does not do so). Popular databases include:
            </p>
            <p class="content__paragraph">
              MySQL is a relational database management system used for data archiving and administration. <br>
              An example of a NoSQL database is MongoDB. <br>
              VoltDB — VoltDB uses memory to store data and follows a relational design pattern.
            </p>

            <h5 class="content__heading2">Conclusion</h5>
            <p class="content__paragraph">
              We trust you now have a thorough understanding of the web development road map. The full-stack web developer roadmap, encompassing the front-end and back-end, has been made clear by this blog. Web designers and developers are in greater demand than ever.
            </p>
            <p class="content__paragraph">
              This is due to the exponential growth in the number of businesses opening online. However, you must prepare yourself and possess the knowledge necessary to help businesses create a distinctive online presence. Due to the market’s intense competition, business websites must understand customer behaviour and be designed in a way that persuades visitors to make a purchase from that business. This is where web developers can make a significant difference.
            </p>
            <p class="content__paragraph">
              If you are passionate about building websites and online apps or working on UI/UX, web development might be a great career. But because it is a field that is constantly evolving, you need to keep honing your abilities to keep up.
